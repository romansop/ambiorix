   @defgroup amxp_expression Expressions
   @brief
   Logical expression parser and evaluator

   An logical expression evaluates to true or to false.

   An expression can consist out of multiple expression parts, concatenated with
   a logical "OR" or logical "AND"

   Syntax of an expression part
   @code{.c}
   VALUE COMPARE OPERATOR VALUE
   @endcode

   Each expression part has compare operator, a left value and a right value.

   An VALUE can be:
   - a field - name of a field, field names may be put between "{" and "}".
   - a constant value - string, number, array, boolean, ...
   - a function - must be a function that returns a value

   Boolean values are case insensitive. There will be a match for true, True or even TrUe.
   The same comment applies to false.

   The supported COMPARE OPERATORS are:
   - "==" - is equal to
   - "!=" - is not equal to
   - "<" - is lesser then
   - ">" - is bigger then
   - "<=" - is lesser then or equal to
   - ">=" - is bigger then or equal to
   - "matches" - matches a regular expression, right value must be a regular expression
   - "starts with" - string starts with a string, right value must be a string (text)
                     or a list of strings.
                     When the right value is a list of strings and the left value
                     starts with any of the strings in the list it is considered a
                     match.
   - "ends with" - string ends with a string, right value must be a string (text)
                     or a list of strings.
                     When the right value is a list of strings and the left value
                     ends with any of the strings in the list it is considered a
                     match.
   - "in" - value is in an array of values, right value must be an array
            When right value is a comma separated string or a space separated string
            the strings are used as an array of values.
            When the right value is a string, the check will verify if the value
            occurst at least once in the string.
   - "~=" - checks if an array of values contains a value, left value must be an array.
            When left value is a comma separated string or a space sperated string
            the strings are used as an array of values.
            If the left value is a string, the check will verify if the value occurs
            at least once in the string.
   - "^=" - string comparison ignoring uppercase/lowercase. Both the left value and the right value
            are converted to string before doing the comparison.

   Supported logical operators:
   - "not", "!" - not
   - "and", "&&" - and
   - "or", "||" - or

   @par Example
   @code{.c}
   first_name in ['Tess', 'Olivia', 'Abraham'] && age < 25

   @ingroup amxp_expression
   @brief
   Allocates and initializes an expression with format-string and safety checks

   Allocates memory on the heap to store the expression data structure.

   The provided expression format string and the replacement values are used
   to build the expression string. In the expression format string the nth placeholders
   is replaced with the nth replacement value in the variadic arguments (`...`).

   The supported placeholders ('%s', '%i', ...) are the ones supported by amxc_string_appendf_escape.

   Example of a expression format string:
   @code
   "password == '%s' and user == '%s'"
   @endcode

   When the variadic arguments are:
   @code{.json}
   ["mypassword","admin"]
   @endcode

   The expression string that is build will be:
   @code
   "password == 'mypassword' and user == 'admin'"
   @endcode

   Each value in the values variant is verified to avoid the expression, or the
   context of the expression, being interpreted in an unintended way.

   Example of invalid values:
   @code{.json}
   ["mypassword' or true or '' = '", "admin"]
   @endcode

   This would resolve into the following expression string:
   @code
   "password == 'mypassword' or true or '' = '' and user == 'admin'"
   @endcode

   Which is not the intention, so the first value is considered invalid and
   the expression build will fail.

   The builded expression string is parsed and stored for later use.
   When the expression is invalid an error is returned and no memory is allocated.

   Once an expression structure is available, it can be reused many times.

   @brief
   Search matching variant paths in a composite variant

   Using expressions or a wildcard '*' at the position of a list variant or a
   table variant the mathcing variants are filtered out. The expressions must be
   put between square brackets.

   All matching variant paths are added to the hash table. The keys in the table
   are the matching variant paths, the values are copies of the mathcing variants.

   Example:

   Data set in json notation
   @code{.json}
   {
      "00:01:02:03:44:f0": [
      ],
      "94:83:c4:06:da:66": [
          {
              "Extender": true,
              "MACAddress": "00:01:02:03:44:f0"
          },
          {
              "Extender": false,
              "MACAddress" : "00:00:55:3b:05",
          }
      ]
   }
   @endcode

   Search path: "94:83:c4:06:da:66.[MACAddress == '00:01:02:03:44:f0'].Extender"
   Result: {"'94:83:c4:06:da:66'.0.'Extender'" = true}

   Search path: "94:83:c4:06:da:66.*.Extender"
   Result: {"'94:83:c4:06:da:66'.0.'Extender'" = true, "'94:83:c4:06:da:66'.1.'Extender'" = false }
