   @defgroup amxp_timer Timer

   @brief
   Timers can be used to do a job at regular intervals or once some time later.

   To have timers fully functional an event loop must be started. The timers are
   using the SIGALRM signal. Multiple timers can be started, but only one timer
   will be the next to trigger the SIGALRM.

   @section amxp_timer_using Using timers

   To create a timer, use the @ref amxp_timer_new function. Some arbitrary private
   data can be attached to the timer. This private data is a pointer to memory allocated
   by the caller and must be managed by the caller. This private data can be changed
   at any time by modifying the priv member of the amxp_timer_t structure.
   The pointer to the private data will be passed to the callback function.
   The callback function will be called each time the timer expires.

   To start a timer, use the @ref amxp_timer_start function.

   By default a timer will only expire once. To have the timer repeat, an interval must be set
   before starting the timer, an interval can be set using @ref amxp_timer_set_interval.
   The interval and the initial expire time can be different. While the timer is running
   the interval can be changed and will take effect on the next time the timer expires.

   A timer can be stopped at any time by calling @ref amxp_timer_stop, to restart
   the time call @ref amxp_timer_start again.

   A running timer can be reset to it's initial value by calling @ref amxp_timer_start again.

   All timers can be disabled or enabled again by callling @ref amxp_timers_enable.

   A timer that is not needed any more can be removed by calling @ref amxp_timer_delete.

   The current state of a timer can be fetched using @ref amxp_timer_get_state.

   @section amxp_timer_el Timers and eventloops

   To make the timer implementation work, an eventloop must be available that monitors
   SIG_ALRM system signal. When the SIG_ALRM is triggered the eventloop must call the functions
   - @ref amxp_timers_calculate
   - @ref amxp_timers_check

   The first one will calculate the remaining time for each timer, if the remaining time
   is 0 or lower the time is expired, the state of the timer will be set to expired state.
   Timers in started state will become active when this function is called.

   The @ref amxp_timers_check will call the callback function for each expired timer and
   reset the state of the timer if needed. This function will remove the timers in
   deleted state from memory.
