   Registers backend interface

   Backend can call this function to register the function table (backend interface)
   in a constructor function.

   The preferred solution however is backend provides the function table using
   "amxb_be_info" which returns the backend information, this information may
   contain the function table.

   The function table must contain at least:
   - A valid and unique backend name
   - The size filled in the stucture must be smaller or equal to the sizeof(amxb_be_funcs_t)
   - And the following function pointers must be set:
      - connect
      - disconnect
      - get_fd
      - read

   When the backend provides the function "set_config" it will be called if backend
   specific configuration options are available.

   @param funcs The back-end function table

   @return
   returns 0 when the function table is accepted.

   when it is not required anymore using the function @ref amxb_be_remove or
   @ref amxb_be_remove_all.

   When a backend's function table is unregistered all open connections for that
   backend will be closed before the function table is removed.

   shared object is closed and loading fails.
