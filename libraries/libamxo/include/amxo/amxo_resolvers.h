   @defgroup amxo_resolver Function resolvers

   @section amxo_resolvers Default Function Resolvers
   The odl parser can resolve functions for a data model functions.
   By default the odl parser supports the following function resolvers:
   - Function table (ftab)
   - Library Import
   - Automatic - the default resolver if no resolver is specified

   In the odl file, the odl parser can be instructed to use a specific
   function resolver. After each function definition a resolver directive can
   be placed. Such a resolver directive starts with "<!" and ends with "!>".

   In between the name of the resolver and optionally extra resolver data can
   be placed. The resolver data is specific for each resolver, please read
   the documentation of the resolver itself.

   Default resolver names:
   - Function table resolver - "ftab"
   - Library Import - "import"
   - Automatic - "auto"

   If no resolver directive is specified, the automatic resolver is used.

   If a resolver directive is specified, the resolver is used, no other resolvers
   are used.

   If a data model can not be resolved, the odl parser continues and the data
   model method exists, but will not have an implementation.

   @code
     %define {
         object Greeter {
             uint32 say(%in %mandatory string message) <!ftab:dump!>;
         }
     }
   @endcode

   @subsection amxo_resolver_ftab Function Table Resolver
   To make it possible for the odl parser to use the function table resolver,
   the function table must be supplied with function pointers, prior to start
   parsing an odl file.

   To supply the function pointers use @ref amxo_resolver_ftab_add

   @subsubsection amxo_resolver_ftab_directive Function Table Resolver Directive

   @paragraph ftab_directive_format

   @code
   <!ftab:FUNCTION NAME>
   @endcode

   The function name is optional, if not given the name of the function specified
   in the odl file is used.

   @paragraph ftab_directive_examples
     Search a function implementation for the data model method "say" in the function
     table resolver, with name "say.
   @code
     %define {
         object Greeter {
             uint32 say(%in %mandatory string message) <!ftab!>;
         }
     }
   @endcode

     Search a function implementation for the data model method "say" in the function
     table resolver, with name "dump".
   @code
     %define {
         object Greeter {
             uint32 say(%in %mandatory string message) <!ftab:dump!>;
         }
     }
   @endcode

   @subsubsection amxo_resolver_ftab_example Example
   In this example, a "say" data model method is defined in the odl file
   under the object "Greeter". The odl parser can automatically bind a C
   implementation to this data model method by using the function table
   resolver.

         object Greeter {

/**
   @ingroup amxo_resolver
   @brief
   Registers a function resolver.

   The odl parser provides already two function resolvers. In most cases this
   is sufficient. Extra resolvers can be registered using this function.

   The resolver must at least provide the "resolve" method, the other two
   are optional ("get" and "clean").

   The "resolve" method is called during the parsing of odl files.
   The "get" method is called when a parser is initializing to fetch all
   default configuration options for the function resolver.
   The "clean" method is called when parsing is done. In this method the
   resolver can clean-up stuff that was allocated during function resolving.

   A function resolver is typically implemented in a library and can provide
   extra API functions. The default "ftab" and "import" resolvers are providing
   extra API functions see @ref amxo_resolver_ftab_add,
   @ref amxo_resolver_ftab_remove, @ref amxo_resolver_ftab_clear,
   @ref amxo_resolver_import_open and @ref amxo_resolver_import_close_all.
   A custom function resolver can do the same, so it is easier for an
   application developer to use your function resolver.

   The name of the resolver must be unique.

   @param name of the resolver, must match the name used in the odl files
   @param resolver the resolver implementation function table

   Adds a C function to the function table.

   Adds a C function to the function table resolver. The same function can be

   Function names can be prepended with the full object path.

   For an example see @ref amxo_resolver_ftab

   @note
   Supply function pointers to the function table resolver prior to parsing
   an odl file. By default the function table contains some parameter validation
   functions:
