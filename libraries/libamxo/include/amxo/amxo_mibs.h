   MIBS are data mode extention objects, A MIB can be applied to any
   object in the data model. The object get extended with the parameters,

   MIBS can be defined in separate ODL files. Each MIB odl file contains
   exactly one MIB definition. The file must have the same name as the MIB
   definition.

   The MIB odl files can contain on the first line a expression definition.

   The MIBS are not loaded, until they are needed. Loading the MIBS and applying
