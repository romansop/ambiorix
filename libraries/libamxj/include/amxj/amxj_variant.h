   JSON String Ambiorix variant implementation
 */

/**
   @defgroup amxj Ambiorix JSON string variant

   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format
   that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value
   pairs and arrays (or other serializable values). It is a common data format with diverse uses
   in electronic data interchange, including that of web applications with servers.

   JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but many modern
   programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. JSON filenames
   use the extension .json.

   This ambiorix library provides JSON parsing and JSON generation features.
   Any Ambiorix variant can be converted to a JSON string and any valid JSON string can be converted
   to an ambiorix variant.

   The Ambiorix JSON variant is using [yajl](https://lloyd.github.io/yajl/) to parse and generate
   JSON strings.

   JSON strings can be read from asynchronous I/O (like a socket) and the full string doesn't have to be
   available at once. The JSON reader keeps track of the current state.

   Besides providing functions to read a JSON string from a file descriptor and writing a JSON string
   to a file descriptor from a variant this library also adds a new variant type on top of the
   standard variant types provided by libamxc. This makes it possible to use the amxc variant API with
   JSON strings.

   Example - Setting a JSON string in a variant
   @code
   void main(void) {
       amxc_var_t data;

       amxc_var_init(&data);
       amxc_var_set(jstring_t, &data, "[1,2,3]"); // variant containing a string with valid JSON
       amxc_var_dump(&data, STDOUT_FILENO);

       amxc_var_cast(&data, AMXC_VAR_ANY); // automatically converts to a variant containing a list.
       amxc_var_dump(&data, STDOUT_FILENO);

       amxc_var_clean(&data);
   }
   @endcode

   In the above example amxc_var_set will fail if the provided string is not a valid JSON string.

   can be fetched using @ref amxj_reader_result.

   allocated memory.
