/**
   @defgroup amxrt_run_time Runtime

   The ambiorix runtime library can be used to easily create a stand-alone
   data model provider application or data model client.

   The runtime library provides:
   - an ambiorix configuration environment (htable variant)
   - an odl parser (can be used to read and write odl files)
   - a data model storage
   - command line argument parsing
   - an event loop implementation

   The simplest possible way to use this library is in this example code:
   @code
 #include <amxrt/amxrt.h>

   int main(in argc, char* argv[]) {
       int retval = 0;
       amxrt_new();
       retval = amxrt(argc, argv, NULL);
       amxrt_delete();
       return retval;
   }
   @endcode

   The above example can also be written as follows:
   @code
 #include <amxrt/amxrt.h>

   int main(in argc, char* argv[]) {
       int retval = 0;

       amxrt_new();
       retval = amxrt_init(argc, argv, fn);
       when_failed(retval, leave);
       retval = amxrt_register_or_wait();
       when_failed(retval, leave);
       retval = amxrt_run();

   leave:
       amxrt_stop();
       amxrt_delete();
       return retval;
   }
   @endcode

   This gives you to possibility to perform other tasks in between.

   @brief
   This function can create full ambiorix application (data model provider or client).

   Typically this function is called from your main. Optionally a command line option
   handler can be added.

   This function will create and start the event loop, and therefor will only return
   when the event loop has stopped. The event loop can be stopped by calling @ref amxrt_el_stop.
   Typically this is done from within an event handler.

   By default following signals are being monitored and handled:
   - SIGINT - when triggered the eventloop is stopped
   - SIGTERM - when triggered the eventloop is stopped
   - SIGALRM - used for ambiorix timers (amxp_timer_t)

   @note
   When using this function an odl file must be loaded (can be an empty one or an odl
   file that only contains configuration). If no odl file was loaded this function
   will return with an error.

   This function will call the following function (in this order):
   - @ref amxrt_init
   - @ref amxrt_register_or_wait
   - @ref amxrt_run - this will start the event loop, the function will continue when the event loop has been stopped
   - @ref amxrt_stop

   Initializes the ambiorix runtime.

   This function will:
   1. parse the command line options
   2. set the default ambiorix config options
   3. load the odl files (if any)
   4. add the automatic load and save modules entrypoint @ref amxo_parser_add_entry_point
   5. load the ambiorix back-ends
   6. connects to all sockets
   7. enable all system signals that needs to be monitored
   8. create an event loop

   The odl file files that are loaded can be passed as command line arguments
   after the command line options. If no odls are provided at command line the
   runtime will try to load the default odl file for the application, using the
   applications name (argv[0]). The default that it will try to load is "/etc/amx/<appname>/<appname>.odl".
   If no odl files are provided and the default doesn't exist, this function will
   continue without an error.

   The (bus) back-ends loaded can be specified using command line option -B or
   added in one of the odl files in the config section with config name "backends",
   which must be a list of backend shared objects that must be loaded.
   If auto-detection is turned on (this is the default), all shared objects that are valid
   ambiorix back-ends will be loaded from the back-end directory (by default this is
   "/usr/bin/mods/amxb"). The default back-end directory can be changed in a odl file
   config section with config name "backend-dir" or on the command line with "-o backend-dir=<thedir>".

   The sockets that the run-time needs to connect to can be specified with commandline
   option -u or in an odl config section with config name "uris" or "data-uris", both
   configuration settings must be a list of uris. The difference between uris and data-uris is
   that when the application has a data model available it will only be registered using the
   sockets that are mentioned in the "uris".

   and long options (staring with a double '-'). Options must be put before any

/**
   @defgroup amxrt_event_loop Event loop

   A default ambiorix eventloop can be created using the event loop functions in
   this library. The eventloop is implemented using <a href="https://libevent.org/">libevent</a>.

   In computer science, the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for
   and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop works by making a request to some
   internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived),
   then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event"). The event loop is also sometimes
   referred to as the message dispatcher, message loop, message pump, or run loop.

   The event-loop may be used in conjunction with a reactor, if the event provider follows the file interface,
   which can be selected or 'polled' (the Unix system call, not actual polling). The event loop almost
   always operates asynchronously with the message originator.

   When the event loop forms the central control flow construct of a program, as it often does,
   it may be termed the main loop or main event loop.
   This title is appropriate, because such an event loop is at the highest level of control within the program.

   When the function @ref amxrt_el_create is called all ambiorix file descriptors (fds) are
   added to the eventloop for monitoring (for read), some system signals are added for
   monitoring.

   The system signals that are monitored are:
   - SIGINT - when triggered the eventloop is stopped
   - SIGTERM - when triggered the eventloop is stopped
   - SIGALRM - used for ambiorix timers (amxp_timer_t)

   Extra system signals can be enabled using amxp_syssig_enable, or a htable list can be passed
   to the function @ref amxrt_enable_syssigs. This will cause that the system signals are
   captured and converted to ambiorix signals. To handle them connect callback functions
   to them using amxp_slot_connect.

   By default all opened sockets (opened with @ref amxrt_connect) are added to the event-loop
   as well.

   The ambiorix signals will be handled in the event loop as well. Ambiorix signals can be
   created using amxp_signal_emit.

   For more information about ambiorix signals see <a href="https://gitlab.com/prpl-foundation/components/ambiorix/libraries/libamxp">libamxp</a>.

/**
   @defgroup amxrt_privileges_caps User privileges and capabilities

   For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations
   distinguish two categories of processes:
   - privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root).
   - unprivileged processes (whose effective UID is nonzero).

   Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged
   processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process's
   credentials (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).

   Starting with Linux 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated
   with superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be
   independently enabled and disabled.  Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.

   In the %config section it is possible to define to which user the started process
   must switch. Typically the process is started as a privileged process (started with
   root user), but it can drop the root privileges and switch to an unprivileged
   process (user id is nonzero).

   When setting the user name (or id), by default all capabilities are dropped as
   well. It is possible to retain all capabilities are (keep all) or only retain
   some.
