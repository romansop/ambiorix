   @brief
   The Ambiorix set is an abstract data type that can store unique values.

   A set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any
   particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical
   concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than
   retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for
   membership in a set.
