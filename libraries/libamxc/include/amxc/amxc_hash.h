   It is a simple hash function using a strange set of possible seeds which all
   constitute a pattern of 31....31...31 etc,

   This is the algorithm of choice which is used in the open source SDBM project.
   The hash function seems to have a good over-all distribution for many
   different data sets. It seems to work well in situations where there is a
   high variance in the MSBs of the elements in a data set.

/**

   @brief
   Calculate a hash from a string.

   An algorithm produced by Arash Partow.
   He took ideas from all of the above hash functions making a hybrid rotative
   and additive hash function algorithm.
   There isn't any real mathematical analysis explaining why one should use this
   hash function instead of the others described above other than the fact that
   I tried to resemble the design as close as possible to a simple LFSR.
   An empirical result which demonstrated the distributive abilities of the hash
   algorithm was obtained using a hash-table with 100003 buckets, hashing The
   Project Gutenberg Etext of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, the longest
   encountered chain length was 7, the average chain length was 2,
   the number of empty buckets was 4579.
